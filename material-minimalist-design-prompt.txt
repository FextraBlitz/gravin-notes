# Material & Minimalist Design Prompt with Dracula Alucard Light Theme

## Purpose
Please help me design my user interface using Material Design and minimalist principles while incorporating the Dracula Alucard light theme, particularly using its purple color as accent.

## Design Philosophy
- Follow **Material Design 3** principles with an emphasis on minimalism
- Use the **Dracula Alucard light theme** as the color foundation
- Apply **purple accents** strategically for visual emphasis and branding
- Prioritize **clean, uncluttered layouts** with ample white space
- Focus on **typography hierarchy** for better readability and structure

## Color Palette Reference
- **Background**: Clean white (#FFFFFF) or very light gray (#F8F8F8)
- **Primary Text**: Dark gray (#333333)
- **Secondary Text**: Medium gray (#666666)
- **Primary Purple Accent**: Dracula Alucard purple (#BD93F9)
- **Secondary Purple Accent**: Darker purple for contrast (#9580FF)
- **Tertiary Colors**: Light purple for subtle elements (#F8F0FE)
- **Surface Colors**: White or very light purple tint for cards and containers

- **Letter Spacing**: Slightly increased for headings (0.5px)

## Component Styling
- **Buttons**:
  - Primary: Purple fill (#BD93F9) with white text
  - Secondary: White/transparent with purple outline
  - Text buttons: Purple text with no background
